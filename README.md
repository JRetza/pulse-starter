[Pulse documentation](https://pris.ly/pulse-docs)

This project is used together with the [prisma/pulse-railway-pg-config](https://github.com/prisma/pulse-railway-pg-config) repo to build a template on [railway.app](https://railway.app). However, you can use this project as a basic Pulse starter project by cloning this repon locally connecting it to any Pulse-ready Postgres database.

## Once the template is deployed

Now you can follow [this part](https://prismaio.notion.site/Pulse-documentation-137ca256325d4a22b80b54a89975f059#e8420b42cfd24b94aa6848a2c4993855) of the Pulse documentation to get started using Pulse in your projects.
